# Hello_Android
Hello Android is a single screen app that has been built For Udacity Google Android Basics Scholarship
during the period of Nov. 2017 â€“ Feb. 2018. The project was the first of three required projects to finish the scholarshipart.

## Quick Overview 

The goal is to create a single screen app to implement what learned so far during that time in the scholarship. 
The requirements are as follows:

#### Design requirements 
 - Project is named `HelloAndroid`
 - Design includes, at minimum, the following text (business name, address, and phone number):
 - Design includes at least one image that the student feels represents the business in some way (creativity is fine, and encouraged!) 

#### Code Requirements
- At least one ViewGroup is included
- XML must include a RelativeLayout or LinearLayout
-	ViewGroups contain at least one ImageView and at least one TextView
-	The project must have one or more ImageViews and TextViews

## App structure 

-	At this stage of the scholarship , a single screen app as described above is required to be built.
-	I did wrap the RelativeLayout root view in a ScrollView in order to make the app suitable for all phone screen sizes.
-	I used nested LinearLayout to include the icons at the top of the page and another nested LinearLayout to include the text
  beneath the icon. ImageViews and TextViews have been used to display the main image, the logo, the company name and the slogan. 
-	Beneath the main image, again I used nested LinerLayout to include Images which should be clickable images once the app has 
  other activities (multi screen app) . 
-	At the bottom of the page ImageViews and TestViews have been used to display company address , tel.,  and other information.
